<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powerships Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-fired Powership</li><li>Gas-fired Powership</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Powerships are mobile power generation units that can be quickly deployed, primarily in developing regions facing electricity shortages. The oil-fired powership market relies on heavy fuel oil, providing flexibility and rapid response but often at higher operational costs and environmental concerns. In contrast, the gas-fired powership market utilizes natural gas, offering cleaner energy and efficiency advantages. Both types address urgent energy demands, with oil-fired options being more versatile in remote locations, while gas-fired options are preferred where infrastructure supports natural gas supply.</p></p>
