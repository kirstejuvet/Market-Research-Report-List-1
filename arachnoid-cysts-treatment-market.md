<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arachnoid Cysts Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Drainage System Surgery</li><li>Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arachnoid cyst treatment market primarily features two main intervention types: Permanent Drainage System Surgery and Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration. Permanent Drainage System Surgery involves the insertion of a shunt to continuously drain cerebrospinal fluid, alleviating pressure and symptoms. Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration, on the other hand, utilizes minimally invasive techniques to create openings in the cyst, allowing fluid to drain naturally, which can reduce the chances of recurrence. Both options aim to manage symptoms and improve patient quality of life.</p></p>
